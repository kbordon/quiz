        <h2>Haru</h2>
        <p>Graceful but occasionally fixate, and always weird as hell. Despite coming off really unapproachable, you seem to have a way with charming people with your outward sangfroid. Despite your actual eccentricities, or maybe due to them, people really seem to care for you.</p>

      <div id="makoto">

        <h2>Makoto</h2>
        <p>Super nice and really reliable, you're like the Hufflepuff of the group. Sometimes though, you might seem a littl weak-willed or a push-over since you try so hard to keep the peace and please everyone. Still, you are definitely the backbone of the group that holds everyone together.</p>

      <div id="nagisa">
        <img src="img/nagisa.jpg">
        <h2>Nagisa</h2>
        <p>Energetic and outgoing, you're a great person to hang out with and always want to try the newest thing. It's hard to be upbeat all the time, and even though it's instinctual, sometimes you use it as a cover. Don't forget to just take it easy once in a while.</p>

      <div id="rei">
        <img src="img/rei.jpg">
        <h2>Haru</h2>
        <p>You're all about precision and meticulousness, and have an appreciation for finer things. Some might consider you snobby or a little high maintenance, but it's alright to have high standards. Especially under that sleek exterior, you are a complete dweeb... in an adorable way, of course.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="rin">
        <img src="img/rin.jpg">
        <h2>Rin</h2>
        <p>Passionate and enthusiastic, you have such a drive for life and your goals. Sometimes, it's intimidating, and you can be jerk to others while being so single-minded. Don't forget about the people who appreciate you while you strive for your endeavors.</p>
